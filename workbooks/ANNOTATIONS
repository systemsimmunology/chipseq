Possible procedure for identifying overlapping or near overlapping genes

Example 
 grep Pdss1: NM_019501 overlaps with NM_007380 ( Abi, which also has other NMs)

Overlap of 
$PY3 pybed.py strand -v 0 -f ../annotation/refGene.mouse.bed ../annotation/refGene.mouse.bed > lookit

grep NM_019501 lookit | grep NM_007380
( shows up once for + and - )

Examine a modification of GenomicFeatureChIPSeqOverlap.py
Would need a library of NMs of eid (and inverse)
- weed out self-overlaps
- a pairwise NM overlap can occur in many rows (right?), so we'd have to uniqueify
- Every NM pair would have an associated Eid pair
- Eid pair can be same-same or different

In annotation
../utils/GeneflankCoords.py refGene.mouse.bed 5000 downstream > refGene.mouse.downstream5kb.bed
../utils/GeneflankCoords.py refGene.mouse.bed 5000 upstream > refGene.mouse.upstream5kb.bed

wget ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/DATA/gene2ensembl.gz 
gunzip gene2ensembl.gz
grep ^10090 gene2ensembl > gene2ensembl_mouse

This seems to be missing many ENSMUSTs so lets use BioMart

GenomeAnnotationsM37.gff has duplicated rows e.g. ENSMUST00000073545
removed them using uniq

cp -p   /Volumes/aderem/ChIPSeq_Analysis/GenomeAnnotationsM37.gff . 

awk '{print $9}' GenomeAnnotationsM37.gff | sed 's/ACC=\"//g' | sed 's/\"\;//g' > GenomeAnnotationsM37.ensids
paste GenomeAnnotationsM37.ensids GenomeAnnotationsM37.gff > tempfile
awk '{OFS="\t";print "chr"$2,$5,$6,$1,"",$8}' tempfile
awk '{OFS="\t";print "chr"$2,$5,$6,$1,"",$8}' tempfile > GenomeAnnotationsM37.bed
rm -f tempfile

go in by hand and remove what remains of comment line preceding miRNA entries
