Look into methods for getting multiple IP results, from larger set of TFs

in
 /solexa/aderem/ChIPSeq_Analysis/PeakFiles
/bin/ls *bed > ~/bedlist

elsewhere
awk '{FS="_"; OFS="\t"; print $1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7}' bedlist | sort -nr > try.tsv

may need some hand cleanup.

File names seem to break down near 2010
